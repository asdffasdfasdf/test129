"2,startup_1,""Mountain View, CA"","" Jun 21, 2013"",Former Employee , Program Manager,""Moving at the speed of light, burn out is inevitable"",""1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.  2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc.  3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).  5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true.  6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a """"con"""" to that, too (see below)."",""1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, """"You have to work on weekends/vacations"""" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am. It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.  2) Poor management. I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence. Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too """"difficult."""" People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into. So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because """"emotional intelligence"""" or """"adaptive leadership"""" are not taken seriously.  3) Jerks. Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same). Years ago, that wasn't the case. I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience. I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.  4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy. So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing. Google says, """"Don't be evil."""" But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices. :("",""1) Don't dismiss emotional intelligence and adaptive leadership. They're not just catch phases. You need great managers and leaders in order to build great companies and develop great employees. The people who may be brilliant at solving technical issues may not be (and are most often, not) the best candidates for management.  2) Do something about that work-ife balance. Don't just have a bunch of pow-wows and tech talks and discussions about it. Leadership should actually model it. Consider re-evaluating how work is done, what processes are in place that are inefficient and ineffective and need to be updated or removed?  3) Don't forget that there is already a pool of incredibly talented people within the company. If career development is really a goal at Google, then do it. Don't just hire from the outside. Take the time to help your employees develop their careers - then maybe you won't lose some of the great ones, and maybe you'll have prevent some of that burn out and disillusionment."",2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2094,5.0"
"3,startup_1,""New York, NY"","" May 10, 2014"",Current Employee , Software Engineer III,""Great balance between big-company security and fun, fast-moving projects"",""* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused). * The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.), overnight ski trips to Vermont, overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer, summer picnics at Chelsea piers, and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially. * Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants. * There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody. * It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are). * The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive. * No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.  Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement. * Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand. * If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance """"even at Google"""" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding, but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance."",""* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension). * The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows, as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse. * Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture."",Keep the focus on the user.

"4,startup_1,""Mountain View, CA"","" Feb 8, 2015"",Current Employee , Anonymous Employee,The best place I've worked and also the most demanding.,""You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.  You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world  You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.  You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing  You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable.  There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.  Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.  Google cares about how it treats its employees.  The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.  There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.  You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.  If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors.  The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk."",""I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.  Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.  You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning. No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.  After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear.  It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.  When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you. Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.  It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge. I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out."",""Keep on NOT micromanaging - that is a huge benefit to Google. Most of us have a huge workload and we work in spikes and not chained to our desks, and we care deeply about producing, and we produce a lot. We can do that because you respect us enough to give us some freedom in how we do our jobs."",2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,498,4.0"

The famous (or infamous, depending on your perspective) perks are just as enticing and rewarding as the hyperbole surrounding them."",""Unfortunately, buses, on-site laundry, and massages don't pay the bills. Google pays exceptionally well, if you're on the engineering side of the company. If not, compensation hardly lives up to the hype. Example: an individual started in an entry-level role and was later moved into a position with much greater impact and significantly more responsibility within the same department. A year and a half later, that individual is still being paid at their entry-level pay and classified as their entry-level role, despite a complete change of responsibilities, scope of impact, skill requirements, etc."",""Internal mobility rules / bureaucracy need a thorough overhaul. Internal rules require that an employee cannot apply for a role outside of their level (L1, L2, L3, etc.) Think purely lateral moves (changing roles) or purely vertical moves (promotions,) but diagonal moves (promotion into a new role) aren't allowed. Unfortunately, this creates pockets of stagnant employees, who have no opportunities for movement, laterally or vertically. For instance, there are approximately a half dozen departments that have full-time employees at the L2 level. But many of those teams do not have an L3 role that doesn't require people-management responsibilities. Obviously, there are a finite number of L3 roles as there is a finite number of people to manage. These L2 employees are effectively capped from promotion until an L3 leaves or is promoted (a frequency of approx 2 per year.) L2's are also boxed in laterally, as there are so few teams that offer L2 roles, meaning they are unable to transition into a role that offers greater vertical opportunities. For comparison, the vast majority of entry-level positions at Google (65% - 75%) are at the L3 or L4 levels, meaning that these employees are able to move freely between teams / departments / product areas, and thus circumvent the majority of these issues."",4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3,4.0"

Everyone is striving for limited promotions and visibility, and that leads to people sabotaging or just not helping each other. - Managers are powerful. If yours doesn't want you to succeed, they have a great deal of control over your future at the company. - Switching teams is not as easy as advertised. Honestly, applying to Google from the outside is easier than trying to join a new team. If your manager doesn't want you to switch teams, you will not switch teams. - HR will not help you if a problematic situation happens. They are there to protect the company. While nice individuals, they will happily tell you untrue information to help Google and hurt you. - Promotion culture is insidious. Everyone is trying to get promoted to make more money, and the system around promotion encourages the wrong kinds of risk-taking: bold but useless new products, hoarding credit, blaming others for your mistakes. - If a product is at risk, one or two people may be collectively blamed to save the whole. I saw this happen multiple times. A deadline is missed, so an agreement is hatched the the problem was person X or person Y. That way, person X or Y can be fired and the others promoted because they made progress despite working with someone as lowly as X or Y. - Fakeness. Individuals at Google are largely wonderful, but the company encourages you to keep and tow the line. Smile. Be Googley. Pretend we're all collaborating openly. But, in the back of everyone's mind is their career path, their promo, and how other people can be used to get them there or discarded if they do not. - A few PMs and manager are very poor performers and their teams suffer as a result. Many PMs and managers are wonderful. It depends on the team you get, which is largely a question of luck. - A culture which somewhat coddles through its benefits leads some to stay dependent and socially immature, especially if joined right out of college."",""- Make switching teams easier. - If it takes 20 people to promote someone, it should not take only one to fire. Don't put all of this power in the hands of a single manager. - Don't encourage people to work extensive hours at night and on weekends. Explicitly Googlers are told not to work weekends, but we all know they do and the culture encourages it. This is unfair to people with families and favors younger people with fewer responsibilities. - Don't promote bullies, even if they get results.

Find a position at McDonalds or sweeping the streets you will be treated with more respect and your mental health will be 100 times healthier. The management team here consists of an older white tyrannical female, I will call her the big Boss, and a black gentleman, merely a lackie. The gentleman is merely a clone of the Boss and too terrified to contradict her. The black gentleman’s wife is in charge of the HR functions at the office, guess what your chances are of discussing and resolving any management issues are. Positions fall into 3 categories, company paid drivers, independent drivers and company paid Para Monitors. These Para Monitors are responsible for the safety of the passengers during transport, generally behaviorally challenged young people with special needs. Drivers are paid by the trip or the hour depending on their classification. Company drivers get assigned generally the long time because the company brings in more revenue. The independents are generally assigned short overflow trips which can earned them as little as $7-10. These drivers pay for their own vehicle, gasoline, insurance and on their own time. Drivers are in great demand due to the extremely high turnover, averaging 3-4 months. Lastly are the Para Monitors who are paid $50 per day for 2 split shift trips. The average work week is presented as approximately 14 hours as opposed to getting paid for 20. Great deal if you aren’t actually working 18-20. Due to the chaotic scheduling you will work one Para trip the remaining hours you will be dragged along with the driver because they lack the time to drop you off at the office. This is regardless if you have a appointment already scheduled. Sadly, it is totally impossible to schedule any personal obligations, such as shopping, doctor’s appointments and the like. The Boss lies when cornered regarding hours stating you are MINE from 6AM – 6PM. The work force is composed for the most part of house wives, retirees, and immigrants. These are the types of people that are focused for employment because they will generally take any kind of treatment and be happy to have a job, however many don’t last long. If you have a conflict with the tyrant boss you most likely will be unemployed shortly. She manages by intimidation. In her quest to terminate you and still not appear to be a tyrant she has been known to elicit the assistance of certain favorite personnel to assist her by lying and discrediting the employee in question. I know of an employee who required a sick day and was told they had to come in and fill out a request for a day off. If they didn’t follow that procedure it could be terms for termination. That employee could not make it in to fill out the request and was terminated. Lying to the employees is commonplace. To quote the big white tyrannical Boss, she stated on one occasion when someone took issue with something “forget them, they are a dime a dozen.” That certainly explains why the Boss focuses on hiring a certain type of individual. Employees are too terrified of the Boss and her insane attitude to standup for their rights for fear of being terminated or reprisal. Which is another whole talent the Boss’s takes to new limits."",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8,2.0"

Fantastic name to have on your resume,""I loved working at Google until I was unlucky enough to be transferred into a team with a bad people manager. This manager ruled through confusion and an iron fist, most likely because it was clear that the entire team was smarter than this manager. I had no clear direction on my role, or even what the outcome of the project the team was working on, no matter how many times I asked. I quickly became bored and frustrated and soon realized that I was not learning anything new, and the transferrable skills I did bring were not being utilized. That's when I started looking outside the company, and here is what I found at my new job: 25% increase in salary, 50% more vacation time and 150% increase in bonus target. Once I left, I realized just how old fashioned Google really is regarding Management, Performance Reviews, and other HR-related issues. Perf and Calibration were abandoned by most companies years ago because it doesn't work in identifying the best performers, but at Google it defines you forever. Lastly, during orientation the advice given to the Nooglers is """"don't be a jerk"""". It turns out that I have never worked at a company that had more jerks than Google. The egos and arrogance I encountered were off the charts. It was easy to overlook when I liked what I was doing, but once I was put under the bad manager my eyes were opened to the ugly reality of working at Google."",Recognize and stop the empire building that's going on at the lower levels.

Promo still requires a """"launch"""" with a right kind of metrics to impress the committee.  Bay Area too expensive. I'm leaving for Seattle -- it's expensive too, but it's *possible* to buy a condo/house there without a ridiculous commute. The past 5 years of price-doubling have prevented me from getting into the market even at my good software engineer salary. Priced out of market -- seriously. The people who can bear to live near work are married Google couples, new grads from India or China living together crammed into crappy small houses... or people who bought a place 5 years ago before $750k, 2 bedroom, 1200 sq ft houses became $1.5M.  My skills were note utilized, I couldn't get transferred onto the right teams where I could apply my Ph.D. research."",""When someone like me gets Strongly Exceeds Expectations 3 times in a row (that's 1.5 years) it's high time for promotion. I'm leaving because I wasn't promoted from 4 to 5 despite long-term dedicated efforts to do so, whereas I have an offer for an L5-6 equivalent position in another major company. I would have stayed indefinitely otherwise. But now I realize that even if I get a promo soon, I'll only get a 6% raise (per policy) and it will still take a year for the RSU benefits to start catching me up to the next level comp. Meanwhile I can get a 25% raise tomorrow by jumping ship. **Note that the delay between """"prove you're performing at the next level for a year (or much more)"""" combined with """"RSUs awarded later on, total comp will catch up eventually..."""" means that I'll be underpaid for 2 years or so if I stay.**  This matters since, while waiting for promo, I've been priced out of the housing market. My friends who are married with a spouse at Google are house-hunting, and younger ones are living together in 5 bedroom places. I'm married and need some privacy, my wife doesn't work, so there's no way to live close to work and I'm sick of commuting. If I had made it to L5 when I applied I'd afford to be staying, but now it's too late.  Also, when I have specialized skills from my Ph.D. and I'm constantly getting moved to projects that aren't making use of those skills, it's annoying. """"Headcount"""" issues on super-appropriate teams for me kept me out of the positions where I would be most useful to Google by applying my Ph.D. work. So I'm taking my talent elsewhere.  All in all, I was greatly disappointed by:  * Extremely slow time-to-promo (due to higher-ups cancelling projects... out of my control).  * Advanced to lead a team of 6 people, at only level 4 (a """"junior"""" role where explicit team leadership is very uncommon) and yet still the promo process didn't value my contribution, even though my manager and director did.  * Cost of living in the Bay Area, and resultant time to commute (Gbus was great but it got old after 5 years)  * Stuck on wrong projects, due to headcount issues/timing/18-months-on-team-before-transfer policy. And bait-and-switch for my initial team due a """"headcount problem"""" where I didn't get into the expected team in the first place.  * Not valued for my Ph.D. speciality skills, but simply as a software engineer.

There is a very strong sense of job security. Food and all of the other perks continue to lead the industry. - You will make some of your best friends here. Most people who get through the doors of Google are truly """"good"""" people, and those who are not often find themselves getting 'managed out' in one way or another. - The SMB Sales/Google Marketing Solutions Org hires some of the smartest recent college grads for their entry level roles - great opportunity to hone skills and grow with the company. - My experience has given me great career growth outside of Google, and it is a great place to be at the forefront of the digital media industry and its future."",""- Perks are great, but don't let that fool you - after your 3 months of organized training is over, you will be so caught up by the never-ending internal metrics tracking your every move. You will have no time to use the nap pod that all of your friends love to ask you about - SMB Sales/Google Marketing Solutions is seen as a """"younger"""" organization within the company and within overall Google sales. It is very difficult to rise the ranks, as this reputation follows you throughout your career journey. - A significant amount of account strategists and direct sales employees within the organization are extremely unhappy. Many are absolutely miserable. The work is mundane and people are constantly complaining as the organization continues to operate across the same metrics, incentives, and programs that it has been for almost 10 years. You will not hear a lot about this, as employees always feel the pressure of saying that they are happy at one of the 'best companies in the world to work for'. No one wants to be the one who is complaining about problems at Google to their friends outside the company. - Perks, culture, and company reputation will keep you way past your expiration date. You will find out you should have moved on way too late. - The hiring bar has severely decreased as the company gets larger. Mediocre employees are hired based on industry experience, but have a very hard time ramping up to Google's way of doing things, and are often unable to keep up. - The process of performance reviews and promotions will at one way or another negatively impact you. It is one of the most dramatic processes, especially in this organization. There are long lists of people 'waiting' to rise to the next level in the company as people are ranked, forcing you to wait your turn in a slowly-moving cycle of burnt out individuals waiting for their recognition. People sit in the same role, burnt out and unhappy, waiting for their chance to hopefully make the next cycle's cut. Promotions lead to generous pay raises, but your job and experience stays the same in most situations."",""Focus on understanding the challenges of your employees and push new innovation to help mitigate their issues. Management is also waiting for their next promotion - always taking the safest route with minimal change or disturbance. Focus hiring and promoting people who are talented and have a passion for sales, and avoid those who are just looking to take any job they can at a company like Google. The company is one of the largest in the world. It is no longer the sexy tech company it once was.

You will have artificially created restraints in almost every aspect of your work.  Here is an example: readability. In order to being able to commit some code at Google you would need to have a """"readability"""" in a language you're writing this piece of a code. It doesn't matter if you have 10 years of experience in that language. It doesn't matter if you have certificate from the company that developed this language. And in order to get readability you would need to write a lot of code in that language. Catch-22. Also, you would have to wait for a pretty long time in the readability queue in order to just start with process. You fill like you lost all the experience you had before with this language. Somebody who has readability and has less experience in this language than you will have power over you. You would have to persuade this other person that your code is OK.  Hypocrisy. They still have courses at Google where they teach you that it is important to have a rest, it is important to manage your energy, it is important to work when you are excited and energized and not work when you're not. This is why they have all those massage chairs. It used to be the company that valued all this. It all changed. I saw my manager writing in 2am and then writing in 6am again. Manager sets an example for it's subordinates and this example is terrible. I also remember my manager writing email about his current state that he is sick. At the same email he tells that """"he will do his best to do some work"""". At the same time this same manager tells everybody else that """"if you're sick - go home and take a rest and don't work"""". I lost respect for my manager long time ago.  They want you to deliver results as soon as possible and yet they don't give you the ability to do it. Instead of JUST DOING IT you would have to write design docs with the future possible architecture (which will always be different because we can't predict software development) and persuade people who have more power than you. Those people will do their best to make sure you don't just start working on your code. You would have to pass several rounds of this absurd.  They told me it is very important to predict how much time it would take to finish the project. I asked them what is the technique to predict unpredictable and got no answer in return. They told me it is very important to make sure you did your project as close to your predictions as possible. I asked them what stops people from deliberately giving very large estimates, completing a project sooner and just do nothing for the rest of the time. I got no answer in return. I completely lost respect this company. This is absurd. The management don't think about what they are doing and why.

There is no dearth of challenging projects that will keep you interested for years. Mobility within the company is easy as long as you are good performer. - You get to work with some very smart people and that makes you perform a notch above. - Management is intentionally less involved in an engineer's life and this avoids micromanagement, bias and single point of failure.

It's great if you truly have that skill."",""- Google is a big company. So there are going to be winners and losers when it comes to career growth. Due to the high hiring bar, most people who don't win are smart people as well and their experience sours. This place is optimized to avoid false positives in every step and false negatives are inevitable. At least when you get promoted, you can feel good that you have truly done something.  - You have to have skill to find impactful areas or projects or start one in order to grow fast. A lot of people can't or don't want to do that. They want it lying there in a platter in front of them (I don't mean this disrespectfully. I have been there). This is why smaller companies or startups look attractive. It's easier to grow in a less competitive place and there is nothing wrong in wanting that.  In my experience, a lot of people who say Google is boring and young & smaller companies are those that are good at building things and solving problems that a thousand other engineers can solve. They just want a place where it hasn't been solved. At google, a lot of your basic services and infra are built. So the problems to solve get substantially more difficult and requires some lateral thinking as well. Again, no disrespect. There are lot of people out there, including me, who would like interesting problems handed over to us.  - in a place of this size, you have to navigate some political issues.  - in critical systems like search, you can just push new things (rightfully so).

"2621,startup_1,""New York, NY"","" Oct 5, 2015"",Former Employee , Systems Administrator,""Great company, but your mileage WILL vary."",""* Google has, bar none, some of the best office schemes I've ever seen. Their conference room layouts make a lot of sense, and the designs and liveliness pouring through those walls were on another level.  * There are tons and tons AND TONS of teams at Google working on close to anything that you can think of, technical or not, and transferring between them is actually encouraged as long as you're on good standing performance-wise.  * Feedback is taken very seriously at Google. It's paramount to their culture and it shows: the Food department cares a lot about turning out high-quality food, People Ops does everything they can to make the employee experience a happy one, etc. Even though it's kind-of a talking piece now, the TGIF sessions with Larry, Sergey and top management are unprecedented.  * The food is quite good most of the time. Some of it's restaurant-quality, even. (It highly depends on the cafe you go to and the food you typically eat.)  * Aside from a tech startup, I can't think of any other place that's on the bleeding edge of technology at this scale. Google is highly, highly experimental, almost to a fault. (More on that in the """"Cons."""")  * Their benefits are really generous for a large org. They're not insanely so compared to others like them, but all of the basics (and then some!) are covered.  * If you like free stuff, Google will bury you with it over time. I didn't work there very long but somehow got two backpacks, a few shirts and a hoodie. Interns get way more stuff, though."",""A lot of the cons below are projections of my experience at Google. Do a TON of research on the role you'll be applying for. Find people on LinkedIn. Scour reddit. Learn as much as you possibly can about what you'll be doing to try and prepare for what's to come.  * Your experience at Google will largely depend on your team and/or manager. If you join a bad team and/or a bad manager, you'll be in for a rough 12 months (the minimum amount of time that's usually required to transfer out.)  * ANYTHING you do or create outside of work is owned by Google, regardless of whether you used their resources or not to do it. This could be a HUGE issue for you if you contribute heavily to open-source and/or like to build side projects. Google's People Ops **do** look out for people doing this too.  * The compensation is okay depending on where you're coming from, but salary is practically non-negotiable (stock units are more flexible, though) and might not even be competitive depending on your area. Lots of funded startups and finance shops pay significantly better for the same level of experience. Additionally, compensation doesn't scale relative to growth. One could double their salary or more within the same amount of time it takes to get from mid-range to senior at Google.  * Almost everything that an engineer at Google uses on a daily basis is home-grown and maintained by other Googlers. Much of this tooling is incredibly complicated and takes months to warm up to. This could be a MAJOR brain drain to consider depending on your career path and/or whether you're thinking of staying at Google long-term. (That said, some of the tools were pretty good, though I usually preferred third-party alternatives for many of the others I worked with.)  * Most of the sexy projects that makes Google Google are in Mountain View, and if you really want to take your career at Google seriously, you'll eventually have to move out there. Living costs in the Bay are insane and show no signs of restoring sanity any time soon.  * Despite having all of the infrastructure to support it, remotely working is generally discouraged by most teams. That said, many, MANY meetings are done completely or partially with Hangouts and Google's solution for accessing internal resources from public endpoints is probably the best there is.  * Their interview process is generally terrible. Engineers at Google generally don't like to interview and/or provide feedback, so the interview experience for potential candidates varies wildly across the board. The process also takes a really long time. It took me about four months to get to the offer stage, apparently, that's normal there. (To put this into perspective, I've worked at places that took a week from cold start to signed offer, they can't possibly not be losing talent from these insane delays.)  * I don't remember seeing more people glued to their phone or laptop in a single workplace before coming here. It seems like almost everyone travels while glued to their phone here. It's maddening.  * Most interviews are focused almost entirely on technical merit. This makes it (much) more likely for engineers with strong technical skills but (very) weak social skills to make it through the cracks. If you're more outgoing and """"extroverted,"""" this might bother you. (It bothered me to no end.)  * There's lots of exciting work being done at Google, but more exciting work usually means even more operational work. A lot of extremely capable people get slotted into doing that sort of work. Do as much research as you can on your role to give you an idea of what you're getting into.  * Technical merit is placed above all else as an engineer. Because this is a significant determinant in promotion decisions, a lot of people spend a lot of time doing """"complex and impactful"""" work at the expense of things like documentation or maintainability. As you might imagine, this leads to a lot of reinvented wheels and deprecation. (It doesn't help that every project seemingly *has* to have a name to it that might or might not have anything to do with the project that describes it.)  * Work-life balance HIGHLY depends on your team. In my experience, people at Google that spent a lot of time working after-hours did so on their own volition (for better or worse). Management never pressured me to work more than I wanted to, in fact, they've had to tell people to ease up!"",""You really need to pay your people better. The market's catching up to you. Discouraging remote workers made more sense in 2003 than it does now. Aside from that, a lot of Googlers seem to be happy and proud of being Googlers and I can't blame them.

Don't get too comfortable or you'll get trapped here."",""-Coworkers talk about the food endlessly, like it's the best and central part of their day. Because it is.  -Lots of NIH and Google-specific libraries which folks can't take with them when they leave. The outside world operates very differently and with different technologies, and people won't learn much of that here unfortunately.  -Lack of freedom to choose technologies. A lot of solutions exist on the outside, but there's often a homegrown competitor that we're forced to use, so it will make that other team look good (lots of folks write libraries and services just to get promoted).  -No Node.js support in production. This is especially painful for aqui-hires because many startups these days use Node. Then they find they need to re-write everything to integrate with Google.  -Checkin + code review process is super bloated, anal retentive, and obsessive. This slows down development time considerably. This is especially painful for aqui-hires, where no one on the team has readability, so you have to make friends within Google just to get your code checked in. Really, really frustrating and the feeling that productivity has gone down immensely.  -Still not a good environment for frontend engineers. If you even hint that you like JavaScript and CSS, people will look at you like you have brain damage. Not a lot of the engineering culture values FE work, although that's a self-admitted problem that they're trying to change.  -Fiscal irresponsibility. Hiring rate within the last few years has been out of control and unsustainable. There is a boom time now, but this is going to hurt and result in many layoffs when the next crash happens.  -Engineering culture (also listed as a pro above). Specifically non-frontend engineering. This is reflected in the ridiculous interview process. It would be good to get more diversity of thought and perspectives, not just a hard-line engineering perspective. So many decisions are based on quantitative data alone, which is a mistake if a company wants to push the boundaries and wants to be innovative.  -Entitlement and elitism. It's not everyone of course.  -High cost of living around main campus.

The perks and food are great, as everyone knows."",""For me, the most difficult aspect of working at Google was the culture, which tended toward elitist, both technically and politically. The sense of competition is keen, not necessarily because of the formal review process, but just because hanging around some of the smartest engineers in the world every day can be intimidating. I frequently encountered coworkers who, like me, felt themselves to be """"the dumbest Googler."""" No one wants to write inferior code or to be thought of as doing so, and for me, the pressure in a public-facing role was even greater. Politically speaking, the culture leans hard to the left and as a conservative Christian, I sometimes felt marginalized by the conversation taking place on emails, G+, and in the office. Still, my immediate team members were always friendly and easy to get along with and i wouldn't trade my time at Google for any other company."",""Don't forget that engineering culture made the company what it is--not only internally, but also externally.

So you have people who sit in a role/team/dept thinking the situation will get better or that management has a good plan, and they'll be fine once they give it a few months. In reality, that person is either overqualified for the role or a bad fit, but are too complacent to change.

The size can be disheartening."",""The organization is increasingly hierarchal, with a long chain of managers. Keeping things flat will help the company stay nimble.

Sure, you can transfer (not easy though), but you'll be doing the same menial clerical work for a different division unless you level up and you'll have to restart your promo clock all over again. Re-orgs are every 6 months, delaying/killing career traction. Layoffs do happen here, but company keeps it quiet. Culture isn't for everyone: very snobby, often distrusting - company culture outside of walls is face value-only. Peers are collaborative only for promotions sake. Lots of bureaucracy and conformity, very corporate culture. Poor camaraderie outside of office. Terrible internal systems. Proprietary Google CRM is a joke. Transfer packages are terrible, HR always finds ways to negate merit increases when transferring by lowering salary, relocation packages are bare minimum (but most people here come from money, so that's ok I guess). Slowly turning into a conventional company, bloated middle-management doesn't ruffle feathers, protects selves vs. team/good of the company. Benefits are decreasing as company grows and becomes more conventional."",""Don't pay lip service to career development.

My work area was a warehouse with open ceilings, concrete floors, and metal desks arranged in groups of six people in a workspace. The interview process was generic, so that once you are approved, you go into a pool of candidates from which managers pick new hires. I only had a half-hour phone interview with my future boss before I had to decide whether to take the position. My boss never allowed me to work with anyone on a project to get me up to speed, despite numerous requests for help. He assigned me the task of writing the specs for a major modification which included several groups not in my area - a task I would not expect of anyone with less than two years experience in the division, yet he assigned it to a person with less than four months experience.

A lot of what you will need to learn to do the job will be specific operational knowledge about how to work that unwieldy beast that is Google's infrastructure.

Lots of technical folks everywhere you turn.,""There is very little emphasis on customers. the majority of folks who work here are motivated by two things: better resume, and tech stuff that one ups other techies.  As a rather high ranking techie from half way across the world, these folks are not at all what I expected in terms of caliber. Communication, people management, keeping a cool head, these things are not common here, and if you have them, they are not appreciated here.  This place is a mecca for folks that can't relate to others very well, but are very technically savvy.  Before you come here there are a few things you need to know: 1) most folks come here because they want to be happy 2) aside from the common knowledge that if you are presently at (be careful of used to work at) Google then you are technically smarter than others 3) Once you leave Google, people will think it was because you couldn't cut it, not because you were amazing. the only way to go is to either A) start your own company (not very common as there is not a focus on customers) B) get poached (very common), but after you have been poached everyone will still think you couldn't cut it at the big Goog. 4) most folks are happy because of 3 things:  A) finding a mate (not very likely at Goog, unless you are hetero female, then game on, except most females here intimidate the guys... lol)  B) making money (yep, you can do that here as well, ironically they don't pay that well for the area: IE you can 3x that in IT Finance or startups, or 2X in places like netflix, not to promote netflix, but they are very interesting if you are heavily motivated by the mulah)  C) making a difference in the world (not super common here)  I know a lot of people who are only happy when talking to other people about their career because they work at Goog, but have pretty much put their life on hold, and their happiness on hold to be here.  Honestly, only work here if you live here. Do not travel to work at Google. It doesn't work out, and everyone ends up leaving to find a mate, more money, Do not move away from family to be here.  Basically work here if you have no other options. If your people skills or business skills are to weak to affect folks, and you are OK not finding anyone special for a few years, and you are OK with really long hours, work here. It is hella good bragging rights to most folks, but once you get high enough in the tech world, it can be a negative.  Actually I should share this as well. the best people at google get poached (startups, other tech companies, etc...) the worst get canned all the people who can fake it stay the people that stay hire other people just like them There are a sea of shitty people growing at Google, beware them, and if one of them is your manager, transfer or leave ASAP, lest you find out the #1 factor of job unhappiness. =)  All in all, if you live in the area, and are just starting your career, please dont let this scare you. This is a great place if you are local, young (22-28), and not interested in finding a mate.

It's refreshing to go to work every day with people who are very smart but still pretty down-to-earth. Another key benefit is the fact that the company is very open in terms of sharing information with its employees. Top-secret projects are regularly shared company-wide and help employees feel that they're really engaged with the company's mission and accomplishments.

You'll work with very smart people, and get a lot of support and feedback around doing your best work. Most senior managers have great knowledge, a lot of advice to offer, and value open, transparent communication. You'll likely work the hardest you've ever worked at Google, but you'll also be greatly rewarded. Also, Google makes it very easy to work your hardest, and that's a huge bonus if you're interested in super-charging your career. Example (day in the life): take free shuttle to work, use available corp vehicles to run daytime errands, grab a hand brewed coffee and gourmet breakfast before starting work, communicate with brightest in your industry during the day, visit a tech-talk and learn something new, workout in the gym w/ a trainer before lunch, have lunch with a colleague at 1 of >15 free themed cafes, grab an espresso shot from the micro-kitchen on way to your desk, collaborate on a new project with someone in a different working group, back to your own work, quick $5 chair massage to rejuvenate, swing by tech-stop on way to grab a new mouse, before your professional desk ergonomic consultation begins, more work, grab gourmet dinner starting at 6:30, woah, it's late - time to go home, grab late (8:30) shuttle home. (I guess i'll have to do my laundry for free at work tomorrow)."",""Google is changing, and it's experiencing some growing pains. There are new projects and focus areas every week, and the grouping of functions and teams changes constantly. As a result, managers are responsible to new macro functional groups, and new projects or focus areas every month or so. This seems an unnecessary distraction, amounting to 25% superfluous work. The change in org structure has made it hard to maintain the career path of your choice. Instead, you must choose from available Google-centric career paths. These are not always (or often) composed of conventional roles, since Google is both changing rapidly, and unconventional to begin with. Most of the people hired at Google 5+ years ago, don't have the credentials to be hired there today. This complicates internal transfers, even though HR attempts to solve that issue. Those joining Google from acquisitions are rarely hirable at Google in any other way, yet their experience and contributions once onboard are typically at par. This again complicates the internal transfer process."",""Be more accommodating to veteran Googlers. The company is changing very fast, and they need active guidance to navigate successfully. Active - not reactive. Be more direct when providing guidance and mentoring to all managers and direct reports. Google is getting a bit too """"careful"""", and I've found that more managers these days are reluctant to tell it like it is, for fear of appearing undiplomatic.

I have been able to pursue several distinct """"mini-careers"""" at the company, with promotions and transfers available as I hit major project milestones. The career environment is ideal for someone who thrives on complexity, who takes initiative, and who communicates well and constantly with technical collaborators.  I feel that management empowers and facilitates individual contributors. You have a fantastic liberty here to challenge how things are done (whether bureaucratically, technically or in product design). Expect fast and constant change. You can step up and drive that change, too, if you have the chops -- the courage to express a coherent vision, and the stamina and depth of skill to follow through. A high impact project at Google can affect a global user base of hundreds of millions (or is it billions now?), and can shape the course and direction of whole industries. You can provide great benefit to users worldwide. The right answer to a search query can literally save a life, reorient a career, or enrich a relationship. And while search is critically important, we do so much more.  When it works, it is a total jazz. When it doesn't work, well, you fail fast and try something new. Everyone outside tends to ask, """"What company will be the next Google?"""", but internally we remain quite ambitious: """"My project at Google will be the next Google!""""  The people here are great to work with. Passionate about ideas, compassionate toward others, with many innovative superstars, and a culture that celebrates diversity. Of course, there is some politics, human nature and fallibility -- as you will find anywhere -- but I find the overall environment positive and well intentioned."",""Working at Google has a stiff learning curve, and it can be challenging to ramp up and get your footing here -- especially if you have been doing software development 10+ years elsewhere and are accustomed to being a big fish. In you aren't on a very short list of luminaries (e.g. a Vint Cerf), then respect and influence have to be re-earned from scratch based on what you do at the company. Your past merits may have helped you get in the door, but inside they buy you nothing. So, to thrive here you have to grow and sustain some inspiration about what's possible, to keep your head above the daily grind of routine work.  Working at Google can isolate you from the global technology community, as well as sometimes from our users. We have our own technology stack and internal lingo, so systems and methods learned here aren't always transferable. We exist in an extreme media spotlight, in highly competitive markets, dealing with sensitive information, so we are very cautious about sharing anything externally. The culture tends to be inward facing: everything is on campus (the Googleplex) -- meals, entertainment, perk, education, tech talks -- so why engage outside of the bubble? Our approach is to solve everything with automation so that the system works on a global scale, but human-to-human customer service does not """"scale"""", and so is sometimes given short shrift."",""I find that Google's leadership is willing to make hard choices with integrity. They are an inspiration -- and they are always challenging us to reach further, try harder, think more deeply."",4.5,,5.0,4.5,5.0,9,5.0"

It attracts so many talent people to work for this company, but in fact, the only give software engineers the special treatment. I've seen so many great engineers in operation team were treated like nothing.  1. management sucks My manager is the root cause that every engineer suffers. He is the best politician I have ever seen in my life. Ever since he promoted to be a manager, he started to play all the dirty games among us. He spent $20 mil per year on some equipments which melt down network connectivity so many times every month. He claimed that the equipments would save Google for 10 millions per year, but in fact, we spent a lot more work hours on trying to solve the problems these junks caused. The main problem is, there is no test base for these junks. Aren't we supposed to test all the equipment before we implement or even purchase them? Not these junks... how does it happen? pick ur guess! How about we go the manger above him. Too bad.. the upper manager is his buddy. There is no complain or any bad thing would ever leak out through these 2 layers of managers. They cover everything up very well. In fact, one of the manager's jobs should ensure the fairness. Well... """"fairness"""" is NEVER been seen at this team.  2. politics tricks My manager has this policy: all the engineers under level III can not talk to the engineers above level IV. Well.... before I join google, I thought anyone could talk directly to anyone, even to CEO. But my manager fired a person who asked questions to a level IV. His recently move was - promoted two of his favorites to be managers and directly reported to him. You know what it means? He just promoted himself since there are two managers reporting to him now. That was the exact trick his upper manager did a couple years ago. Now... there are 3 levels of management under one director. How does this director allow this happen?? well.. that's the politics. So, when the new engineer join the team, how many levels above him?? It's IMPOSSIBLE that you get promoted if there is one new layer added. Most likely, you got downgraded every year!!  3. STEALING/CHEATING I've never seen so many cheating cases ever since I graduated from college, but here, at Google. We have two level IV engineers responsible for designing networks with one stealing ideas/credits from the other one's work!! And this cheating is permitted by the upper manager!! How did it happen? well... the managers playing the games. The two (now three) levels managers ensures that none of outside team could work with the talent engineer alone. When they steals, those seniors all lined up and the upper manager would give pressure down to turn in the design and the credits. Whoever on the same side of this level IV engineer would suffer a hard time and have bad reviews from those managers. So, we watched the stealing and cheating happening every day but no one dare to say anything.  <to be continued>"",""I thought Google was not a place for the politician to play games with every day.

Groups are all very autonomous, so individual engineers have a lot of control over direction of the group and responsibility for the success of the team. The company assumes you're going to be thinking about more than getting to your current milestone, and expects you to think big and aim for large goals.  I've found the other engineers sharper and more accomplished than anywhere else, everyone has shipped great things before, and they're eager to do it again. It's not surprising to be working with a 24 year old who sold a company, two senior engineers who were VPs at startups, and a well-known researcher in a particular area."",""It's a cross between grad school and a hundred little startups. I haven't always gotten guidance from management about what's important or how the teams need to work together. Like grad school, there's times where it does feel all your responsibility. Marketing and bigger vision sometimes comes from the product managers, but it always feels like individual advice rather than a single clear vision of where we should go.  Individual teams have a lot of control over libraries and code they use, so lots of infrastructure projects grow as research projects that succeed only if adopted by significant numbers of other teams.  Although there is a big vision for the company, it isn't as focused or controlled as in other companies, there's really an assumption that the right stuff will bubble up. It's not a place with the razor-focused direction.  Initial titles/ranks and promotions are determined by committees of other engineers. This is great because you're recognized for your engineering work, but bad if you aren't churning out enough code or if you're not having enough impact on the rest of the company. Initial titles get assigned 6-12 months in when you're put in the same pool as existing Googlers who are up for promotion. If you don't match up to them, you go down a slot - no difference in salary, bonuses based on new level, and any mental scars from being judged unworthy. It doesn't really matter, but if you're at Google you're probably not used to failing.  Everyone's driven to succeed. There may not be a lot of external pressure from management to pull long hours, but folks tend to do it anyway because they want to accomplish something great. It's an easy place to feel you're below average, even when you've been tops everywhere else."",""Keep helping us focus on the vision of what we need to accomplish.

My manager never once created an annual or quarterly strategic business plan. He (actually *I*) filled in the template given by management, but he never created a plan we could work toward. As a result, people did what they wanted, which was not always most profitable (in part because short term incentives don't align with long term profitability). This created a lot of problems. In 2007, the company created a new layer of middle-manager jobs and hired people internally...without training them to be managers! Disaster. Lots of inefficiency and broken promises. Horrible decision that continues to plague employees. There are some good managers, I just didn't work with any. -No career development. Minimal worthwhile training. You can take a course here and there, but when it comes to moving around the company, watch out. Sales, Engineering, and Enterprise are silos---you can't move between them. *Everyone* complains about this. Smart people have for years been talking about leaving. -They fired most of HR in 2009 (the others have always been contract workers without benefits), what remains of HR is really weak. HR is never helpful anyway. -No one """"owns"""" decisions (not even managers or their managers!), but everyone gets a say...so few risks get taken and greatness rarely evolves beyond the idea stage -There's a lot of mediocrity, why improve when improvement might require you or teammates to work a little smarter or harder? Lots of resistance to change that requires more work. -Flat organization is bad for people whose work shows skill beyond job level / area & typical promotion cycles (senior management encouraged national sales team to think of lateral moves as promotions...even though you don't make more money, get better titles--and then must start the promotion journey afresh as if you had never worked there before) -Salary. When Google offered me the job, a well-known, respected web property with a similar job did as well. The latter offered me TWICE as much money as Google. Twice! And all the good benefits. -Salary increases over time. When you're promoted, you don't make all that much more. Bonuses are small (and taxed at 50%). Options are not worth as much as you think. And you don't get as much stock as you think, either. (These are taxed at 50%, too, so you don't really get very much!)  All of this relates to the non-engineering side. I always really liked the engineers and when I worked with their projects found great synergies. Unfortunate the sales side made it so hard to move over!"",""Teams need better direction. Many managers are very poor leaders who don't make decisions or set clear goals or make teammates accountable to those goals. Just letting everyone do their own thing is a problem...especially when multiple positions have to support multiple people whose own agendas create conflicts of interest (and inefficiencies and tension). You need to give stars more opportunity to grow, they need more than just new projects. You need to actually develop these people. You know that salespeople are not the only stars or potential future leaders. You need to reward and grow more than just the salespeople. Because, let's be honest, many of the salespeople are not the ones growing the revenue. They get the credit, but in the end you lose some of the people most responsible.

"4741,startup_1,""Mountain View, CA"","" Jan 3, 2009"",Current Employee , Technical Writer,The very best reason to work at Google can be summed up in one word: culture.,""The very best reason to work at Google can be summed up in one word: culture. Since that is a rather vague term, let me elaborate. Google has established and continues to nurture a culture that fosters, high levels of both work satisfaction and contribution from its employees. It does this by recognizing the potential in all employees via established work policies, rather than just through lip service, like many companies. Following are some concrete examples of this:  Promotion and work performances is entirely reliant on peer reviews. In other words, to get ahead at Google and to get a positive performance review, you must get positive reviews from your fellow co-workers. Your manager might love you, but if your co-workers don't like you, you have some work to do. Managers are also required to seek peer review from those they manage. (I have never seen this before in my career.) Senior level employees from other fields are also encouraged to seek peer reviews from people in other departments. For example, engineers need reviews from people other than engineers in order to advance. For this reason, a culture of cooperation is endemic at Google. This is great because the percentage of """"cowboys"""" that seems common at other high tech companies is quite low at Google. It also fosters an awareness of the type of contribution made by people outside your department, since everyone reviews people in other fields, and therefore must learn a bit about what others do outside their sphere.  Career tracks fall into either management or individual contributor. This is great for people who might want to try management but later decide that they perform best as an individual contributor, or who just want to take a break from management for a while. In addition, it's not too difficult to switch between tracks. Finally, managers and team leads are also encouraged to solicit leadership-level contribution from the reportees, as a way to encourage career growth and to share the load, so to speak. This whole mechanism results in a very strong sense of independence and high-level of function from everyone, because if there is a problem that you think should be fixed, you can fix it and get genuine recognition for it, both from peers and managers.  You are required to keep a work log, as a means for you to accurately report on your contributions and as a source for your own assessment and of others' assessment of you. In addition, there are other assessment tools that are big part of Google work life, designed to keep you mindful of your work contribution and to help you and others write performance reviews. This sort of sounds tough, but the end result is that you can work to your best and not have to worry about mis-perceptions of your performance: you've written it down. Additionally, if you are spending a LOT of time working on tasks not related to your main project, your log is a way for you to work with your manager in order to change unnecessary demands on your time. I would say that this practice exemplifies one portion of the transparency that is so pervasive at Google.  Ideas and contributions from employees are highly encouraged. This results in some great products for the company, like AdWords, which was an idea from an early Google engineer, and Gmail, which was a 20% project. Googlers also gain a lot of company and community recognition for extra efforts/contributions that they feel passionate about, and this only adds to the environment for everyone. As another example, some employees at Google Mountain View worked hard to create alternative means of fresh drinking water for employees, rather than having the company stock water bottles (which contribute tremendously to landfill waste). This was a big effort. Now we have filtered water stations all over the place--it's not directly tied to """"search"""" but it contributed to the company mission to """"do no evil"""" and it added to the green image of the company.  I could go on and on about culture at Google, and I've only scratched the surface, but hopefullly this conveys a sense of what I mean by """"culture"""" at Google and how important this element is to a great working environment."",""From my four years of working at Google, I've seen the following downsides:  * In sales, management level employees tended to be hired from MBA programs rather than be promoted from within. I was not personally affected by this practice, but I witnessed the demoralizing effect this had on a good number of very high performers who would have benefitted from a performance-education program so that their level of effort and seniority would have been recognized. In addition, as is almost always the case from hiring outside management, there was a great deal of frustration from employees because the manager was completely unfamiliar with the culture and process at Google, and this resulted in a feeling of being managed by someone who learned management at Harvard or Yale.  * Google """"over-hires"""" people. By this, I mean that Google regularly staffs highly-qualified people in positions that are not suited to their level of education. So, for example, you would see software engineers being hired by support. That's just stupid. I appreciate the high standards that Google has for its employees, but I genuinely think they tend to over-correct in that regard, and this results in people not really being suited for the position into which they are hired. Sometimes it's possible for such people to migrate to other positions within the company to which they are better suited, but often this results in a level of frustration... mostly in this case people find work elsewhere, but in the mean time, this very necessary position must be filled by another hire, which then must also be trained. Not efficient, and not effective. Google also tends to focus hiring assessment on academic scores, which is entirely appropriate for new grads, but they do this even for people with multiple years in the field. That's just silly, and it actually does run contrary to the whole performance process within the company itself, where effort and accomplishments are recognized. Thus, it makes no sense to disregard this type of assessment for new hires whose professional contribution can far outweigh their academic performance by many years.  * Google encourages employee contribution to so many different projects that it is difficult for someone to get """"deep"""" into a particular project and focus entirely on that effort. In this, I am speaking from my own personal experience. I feel that volume of contribution is valued at times over quality or depth of contribution. There is a sort of """"check list"""" mentality where, the more bullet items you can point to, the more you are seen as a strong contributor.

Google is deteriorating at the edges. Many managers at Google got their jobs just by having low employee numbers and are otherwise unqualified. Once entrenched they tend to show little concern for their reports, concerning themselves with """"managing up"""" to their own manager. Google is supposed to have a project matrix where tech leads are peers, not managers, but managers commonly flout this and micromanaging is endemic. Moving between projects is limited by complex procedures and is rarely attempted. In satellite offices the selection of projects to work on is limited and to make matters worse it is discouraged for engineers to work on projects not centered in their own offices. Being friends with your manager is a more effective way to get promoted than showing competence. In fact, showing too much competence or initiative is a good way to earn the ire of your manager. Performance evaluation is supposed to be by peer review but in reality, feedback from peers is ignored and only the manager's rating is taken seriously. Political infighting and character assassination are increasingly the norm at Google. Managers turn a blind eye to it, perhaps because they have found such techniques useful in developing their own careers. Google base compensation is on the low side, and is supposed to be more than made up for by incentive bonuses, but these are largely illusionary because few employees receive the necessary """"exceeds expectations"""" performance evaluation. Managers at Google tend to consider themselves special people, better than engineers. Few will bother to greet or otherwise acknowledge the existence of anybody other than another manager if they pass them in the hall. Except for the weekly TGIF cross-company sessions where the founders candidly answer questions from all employees, management at Google is increasingly secretive about procedures and plans."",""Google engineers tend to be first rate but managed by unqualified, self-obsessed managers who were promoted into their positions just by being in the right place at the right time. This cannot possibly be optimal for Google's long term growth. Listen to all the voices trying to tell you this. Stop listening to the voices of managers telling you what a great job they are doing, because their main skill is self promotion. They don't care about the welfare of the company or their reports, only about themselves. From their point of view the system is working well because they are free to do as they please.

It doesn't matter what your degree is in or how long you've been at the company -- if you get stuff done and do it well you'll be treated well. And, of course, the coworkers are luminaries, but they tend (in my experience) to be accepting of newcomers without the same background. I've had no trouble digging my fingers into topics from machine learning to the Java virtual machine, learning all the while. The company has some communication silos due to its size, but the walls aren't solid -- I routinely hack on other peoples' code, and they hack back. It's all very open.  They really pull out all the stops to make sure engineers can do their job, whether you need a second workstation, a thousand more machines in a datacenter, or scones. Information flow within the company is still quite free, particularly compared to Microsoft or Apple.  Managers I've interacted with are sharp and encourage good work-life balance, reminding employees to take time off and guarding against burnout. My managers have constantly communicated their expectations and our performance, and have actively worked to help me in my career development and promotions -- or, when a project slips off track, to understand why and help.  And, finally, I think Google's pay is pretty darn good. Microsoft recruiters assure me that it's 30% lower, but I've got friends at MS and those numbers just don't add up. This site should do a good job showing the true situation (and the resulting competition will help us all!)."",""You are expected to deliver. This doesn't mean 80-hour work weeks (at least in my end of the company), but you are expected to make goals and hold yourself to them -- and ideally deliver something that beats the rest of the industry while you're at it. Do not come to Google expecting a research environment, there's plenty of research going on, but if it's not in your 20% time you'd better have something to ship. I list this as a con only because I suspect this bit some of the people who rated Google negatively.  The company has grown really fast. This has caused some strain, both in terms of infrastructure and in communication. Many of the nooglers are fresh out of college, and the naivety cuts both ways: they're simultaneously over-eager to re-engineer everything in sight, and bitter when perks change or they don't get promoted fast (nevermind that it's still better than the rest of the industry -- they've never been there). With rapid growth comes a lack of focus, as well, with weird projects with no monetization story. (Caveat: I'm in Ads, where money matters.)  I get the impression that we've got our share of bad managers. My manager (and the two immediately above him) are all great -- technically sharp, caring, and happy to get their hands dirty. But I've heard horror stories from other teams, and you can read plenty of them on this site, I'm sure -- preference for low employee numbers, suckups and yes-men, etc. I suspect most of the thoroughly bitter people have gotten a bad manager and not requested a transfer out from under him/her.  On that note, Google does a bad job of handling underperformers. They try hard to help crappy engineers and managers improve, but at some point you've got to cut your losses -- a bad employee, particularly one with a bad attitude, is poison that eats away at morale. I've seen people go through two or more performance improvement plans before finally getting the much-needed axe.  Google also does a fair-to-middling job of handling *overperformers*. I've gotten a few spot bonuses for successful projects (which, to be fair, were tens of times larger than the bonuses I got at similarly-sized companies in the past), but the motivating effect of the Founder's Awards are gone. No matter how many millions of dollars you make the company, if you're not in LSE's pet segments, no Founder's Award for you -- it'll go to some guys in search or something. Google is done making millionaires -- for those of us who got who got here after the IPO, the only way we'll retire is a 401(k). Again, having worked in industry outside of Google, this makes me wistful but not angry. I don't expect other people to make me a millionare.  And, finally, your family will ask you questions about everything Google related. Be prepared to have to explain dozens of times that you don't actually work on Search/Maps/Writely/whatever and can't fix their pet problem. :-)"",""Focus, focus, focus.

Product managers are there to work with engineers to direct the product, as their job is to know the customers and the marketplace and come up with a good direction for products. Because a lot of what the marketplace wants is illogical, engineers often argue with product management, and such behavior is part of what makes engineering a great place to be. You can actually have a significant impact on product direction.  Additionally, Google is very fair about how promotions work. The engineers who impress their colleagues get promoted. Those who don't impress their colleagues don't get promoted. Thus, most good engineers will get promoted. I've heard lots of people complain about this process, but usually I hear this from engineers who aren't that impressive. It could be that the explanation for *why* they aren't getting promoted isn't transparent enough...but I don't know.  In almost all situations, you are in control of your own destiny at Google. You set your own goals. You set your own timeline to achieve those goals. Management is there to guide you in setting these goals, but it is your duty to set good goals and strive to achieve them. This is also very empowering, and avoids the micromanagement that occurs at other companies.  Then there's the obvious, which everyone else has already mentioned, like the *great* food, the massages, the really understanding/flexible management when it comes to personal issues, the good benefit package, etc."",""Google is big, so your impact often seems tiny with regard to the company as a whole. Things are gradually getting more and more bureaucratic, the pain of being a public company with profits to protect. You gradually feel less and less important to the company as time goes on, as the company grows to many 10s of thousands of employees. Things like the Founder's Awards, which originally were supposed to be motivating factors to great products could end up being demotivating for many. For example, if you are stuck on a project that is in maintenance mode, or if you launch a great product that is overlooked, you might have little motivation to work hard again."",""Management probably needs to start looking into what each engineer needs to be his/her best.

Management in the sales organization is poor, with an influx of MBA managers coming in and trying to dictate how to run the organization without much background or knowledge of how the department works. Morale is at an all-time low within the sales org, with employees frustrated that they've hit the invisible but definite glass ceiling for promotions. One of the biggest problems in the sales org is that Google hires the best and brightest -- from the Ivies and other name-brand schools -- and gives them a job to do that high school graduates alone could perform. This leaves a bunch of smart and disillusioned employees wondering how they entered the organization in the first place.

Google fosters a college or academic feel where you never need to leave the campus in order to find sustenance or a respite from the daily grind. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are offered Monday through Friday, and the food is pretty good (keep in mind I'm comparing it to other free food…so how can you really complain?). Google-colored Swiss balls (those bouncy orbs you see freakishly fit people doing sit-ups on in infomercials) invade the office cubicles and give the workspace a much more play-pen sort of feel. To bolster the dorm room ambiance, Google also supplies pinball machines, foosball, ping pong & pool tables, and assorted video games. Foam darts are passed out for 'dart wars' during especially hectic times, and silently encourage the employees to roll away from their ergonomically arranged desks to fling projectiles at unsuspecting coworkers. After a grueling week of work, an employee can look forward to a company-funded bender in the form of microbrew beer (both on tap and in bottles!), wine, and the occasional Jell-O shot. If the alcohol upsets your stomach and a retreat to a bathroom is what you crave, fear not! In addition to having showers in almost every building, Google boasts toilets with heated seats, built-in bidets, and dryers for those who prefer to relieve themselves in a more """"green"""" fashion."",""If you enjoy your individuality and time alone, Google is not the place for you (keep in mind I’m not an engineer). Google pushes a highly """"googley"""" atmosphere, which is something akin to what the Brady Bunch would be like if they lived in communist Russia. Everything from the carpet to the bathroom tiles incorporate the Google colors into its design. People are encouraged to have googley attitudes, wear plastic smiles, and not to question the infallible nature of the executive management group. Marathon hours are the standard because, after all, employees are practically encouraged to bring a cot and sleep there…barracks coming soon (really?! no, not really). If you like feeling awkward during forced group activity, Google is your haven. It isn't exactly """"forced"""" (no guns), but if you don't participate you become labeled as """"ungoogley."""" Once deemed “ungoogley”, you're practically viewed as a rotten apple that threatens to spoil the bunch. If you can endure and appreciate the googley atmosphere, you might also enjoy Google's uncanny ability to clot information within the hierarchy. Very little is shared throughout the company because from the moment you're hired, secrecy is revered. But to be honest, most of those who read this review won't even be able to get a job there.

If you went to Podunk U, your chances are worse than the rumored 1% of applicants.

Some of the perks are also weakened or made useless: attending external conferences can be expensed only for 1/3rd of the cost of the ticket, or 2/3rd of cost of the ticket only if approved by the manager (which in my experience is never granted, unlike what happens with Google's competitors), otherwise you'll also have to use your days off to be able to attend the conference (putting some severe disincentives for you to attend).

Transparency has been steadily going down for years, you hear about projects when they're announced or leaked. - Several high-level execs seem to have a pretty weak ethical compass. Increasing number of ethical scandals, antitrust fines, etc. Internal explanation often weak and unconvincing around these issues. - Lots of talk of being data driven but what's common is data being used to justify whatever fits data slinger's narrative, including for myopic goal setting that results in adverse second and third order effects (see Goodhart's law). - Increasing attitude of engineers just doing whatever they're told, forget the """"do the right thing"""" of old times. - Project and product churn. Google products are often unfinished and buggy, UIs changing all the time. Lots of talk of rewarding product excellence but lots of cynicism about it (I don't buy it, I don't see the products getting better). Product managers compete to launch features, engineers have increasingly less power to make product decisions. - If you're more senior you might get pushed to do management, the old days of having a technical individual career option seems over in many teams, at least if you want to get promoted. - Internal frameworks tend to be overengineered and complex because of many disparate use cases and legacy, easy things take a long time as a result. Critical internal tools can be unstaffed while projects that go nowhere (how many chat apps?) can have massive headcount. - Crowded noisy open floor offices, with little privacy. I heard some folks outside engineering don't even get a fixed desk anymore. - AI seems much more important than privacy. Products and strategy seem aligned with getting Google more and more data.

You can learn relevant product knowledge if you want to bootstrap something later on."",""- Promotions solely based on something they like to call VISIBILITY. Useless projects get started all the time just to be cc'd on emails to Director-level and above. Those projects in most cases lead to nothing and don't produce ANY results at all, it is solely done for the purpose of being able to mention one's """"great"""" initiative in the next performance review cycle. Another factor they promote on are several """"soft attributes"""" which is a way for management to promote on subjectivity. - You are always told the company is a meritocracy eventho it is clearly not. This incongruent messaging compared to reality is extremely frustrating. It does not matter at all if you reach 100% of your target or 200%, what matters in the end is the above mentioned visibility. Another proof is that I heard managers say """"Oh, he has been here already for 2.5 years, we have to promote him now"""" which is a joke and demotivating for high performing folks. - The metrics you are measured on in an Account Management role are only indirectly linked to revenue and are manipulated by the vast majority of reps once they have been on the job for a quarter and know the drill. Management knows this but does not care since they look good in front of their own bosses if the numbers look good. The best of the manipulators do not have to work at all to reach their targets. - Many of the middle managers are incompetent and have been stuck in their role for sometimes nearly a decade. There is no real willingness to achieve something great and make progress, but those people are just happy where they are in their career and spend their whole day wasting everyone's time in meetings or sending out useless emails. Very limited learning opportunity if you have a manager like this and very demotivating because no one wants to end up like them. However, there is the rare exception of a great manager. - Leadership cult, people of levels of director and above are worshipped through the entire organization and are treated like god's gift to everything. Some of them are admittedly great, some of them aren't. - Learning curve will be non-existent at the latest after 6 months and you will be doing the same day in day out. You can learn by yourself some new stuff with the great online training database, but the main thing you are doing gets old quite soon. - A lot of people drink the kool aid. There are quite a few critical people like myself in the organization, but a majority of people think they are on top of the world because they work in one of the least respected role of a prestigious company. People are not """"super smart"""" everywhere, they hire basically everyone and it is just luck getting through the interview process. 90%+ of hires come from personal referrals since their CVs wouldn't go through the official channel. Level of entitled and incompetent people can be extremely high in certain teams."",""Get rid of some of the terrible sales team managers. Rethink the entire system of productivity metrics (Apollo made it easier for smart people to manipulate everything, it is a complete joke and demotivating to honest reps. The idea behind it is good, but the execution couldn't have been worse, no matter how much it has been promoted as a great thing by the leadership). Promote on performance (once the metrics actually mean something) and not on visibility. Increase hiring bar.

For the US it has a quite good corporate culture with much individual freedom. Compared to the Nordic countries in Europe, it's about par for the course compared to startups and smaller companies.  Compensation is good, but is also geared towards keeping you at the office more (food benefits and various services etc).

If you're outside the US, count on there being late night and early morning Hangout meetings with US/India several times during the weekdays.  If you're working in engineering but not as a software engineer, you will have a hard time getting good performance reviews, as all teams will value their own higher than outsiders.  Compared to other companies in more forward-thinking countries, Google is about par for the course compared to individual freedom, but you still have have the US-styled meddling micro-managing bosses.  There is great inertia in making things happen at foreign offices, things that were implemented in the US took 1-3 years to happen in Europe. If there was a tax deductable benefit that was available in your country but not in the US, it could take even longer to get it set up. The really good benefits never make it outside Mountain View.  The workplace in most offices is really crappy, the norm is small desks (hope you're not sitting opposite someone with long legs), crappy chairs, people bunched up together.  Unless you work in ads, you should be expecting your project could be shut down at any minute. If you work in ads, you'll be under pressure to make more money to the company. Even if you implement a change that increases company revenue by millions of dollars, don't expect that it will affect your bonus or salary more than an extra $10k or so - you've proven your worth, but if they pay you too much, you might leave to pursue other interests."",""Pretty much all managers I met at Google seemed great at the surface, and few of them did anything really bad towards employees.

It's still the best large corporate to work for in my book. If, that is, you want to work in a large corporate. If you're in the right org or product area within the company it is possible to get to work on some fantastic projects and for your career to progress - a rising tide lifts all boats as they say. However..."","".... if you are in the wrong org, one that is not growing or has poor leadership or mid-management, get out fast! You are on a dead end track and nothing you can do will change that.  The company has grown so large so quickly and you can really see it is wrestling with all the problems of adolescence, with bureaucracy and politics exploding in the years I was there.  Performance management is broken and the best people do not always get the rewards they deserve. Adept upward management rather than doing the best job has become the surest way to rapid career advanceent. This is a real shame and needs to be nipped in the bud asap. It is not clear that the senior management are really aware of this or have the means or desire to get to grips with it."",""Firstly, fix perf. Remove direct managers from involvement in who gets promoted and when through better use of real-time 360 degree feedback tools. Either make Levels truly fungible across orgs or better still bin them all together. Reward people for doing their actual jobs well rather than for side projects of questionable added-value which are undertaken, normally just before a perf cycle, to show 'Innovation' and 'Googleyness'.  Secondly SVPs and VPs need to get out on to the frontlines and see what the footsoldiers see and experience, Undercover Boss style. What they hear from their management teams one or two wrungs below them is glossed over veneer, it is not the real picture. The best political operators in the middle-management ranks are adept at crafting the story they want to tell you. They will select only those data points which support their case and willfully omit all others.  You would learn a lot more from unnannounced visits to offices and teams than you do now from the stage managed state visits which have become de rigour.

Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Even though they are participating highly both in terms of operations and projects. Managers make false underhanded promises about being kept on to many contractors in the hope that this will motivate people to work even harder. But people talk and such strategies become transparent. It is embarrassing spending so much money on parties/off-sites etc. while the contractors slave away and then are told there is no budget to keep them on. (Many of them are far more intelligent than the FTEs and working much harder, and it feels like they know that and are just using them for as much as they can) Googlers have a tendency to become entitled and egotistical. Yes, the physical workplace is great, but it is too much of a bubble and actually the environment is stressful and not really all that friendly. Even the Kitchen staff seem miserable. The expectation of excellence is fraught in the air, which often results in an underhanded competitiveness between team members and long, long working hours. Ya those pool tables are nice, but I never really had time to play them. Googlers are too mono, there is no diversity in thought, age, race etc. Which is a huge criticism really when you think of the values they hide behind and the people they should be considering. If you strip away the benefits and the incredible value of having Google on your CV, this would have been one of the worst employment experiences in my life. I think the difficulty is getting to grips with the frustration of how they are perceived, and how they actually operate. Many of the FTEs have worked nowhere but Google and think they are uber fantastic for having landed a job there and what they are doing is the most important thing in the world but there lack of life experience shows massively in how they handle their work and many of them feel like they are part of a cult."",""Get over yourself and drop that ego. There are doctors, teachers, nurses...all sorts of people in the real world doing amazing things. We are just serving those people so take a slice of that humble pie. Step back, stress is not productive, trust your team to get things done. Learn about people, care about people...at the very least the people on your team who are working incredibly hard. If you told some managers that your whole family was just killed in car crash, I don't think they would even have a fundamental human capacity of acknowledging that.

You need to be very flexible since there are constant reorganisations. Changing desk locations, teams or team leaders multiple teams per quarter is no exception.  A lot of people are very career driven and only focused on achieving targets, resulting in a tense atmosphere (co-workers are often seen as competitors for promotion instead of colleagues)."",Don't be so picky when recruiting people for the AdWords Customer Service (why do people need a Masters degree to answer phones all day long??).,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2,4.0"

One of the things I enjoy most is listening to the founders (Larry Page and Sergey Brin) talk at large meetings (especially David Drummond, when he shares news). They're both funny and intelligent, and I think their reputations as visionaries are probably mostly accurate."",""My experience here is limited, but most of the people I know who started around the same time as me have identical complaints: Google doesn't want thinkers for the majority of their engineers, they want short-order cooks and yes-men. In all my career, the only place I've worked that was even comparable to Google was Wells Fargo (which was a ridiculously unfulfilling place to work as an engineer).  Additionally, the culture at Google is very snobby compared to other places I've worked. Managers love to reiterate lines like """"we hire the smartest people in the world"""", and a lot of people seem to eat it up. One could argue that this is harmless placating, but the level of groupthink present all over the organization is appalling. Many even consider """"not invented here"""" a legitimate reason to build something from scratch, even when there's more robust free software out there (I've been pressured into doing this several times, since the approval process for 3rd party code is so painstakingly bureaucratic).  Lastly, I don't feel valued, respected, or even acknowledged by managers. I end up working nights and weekends every week because of clear organizational mistakes being made by managers or other teams. I have been told personally by a manager that a reason for me being pigeonholed into a role I hated was because I didn't go to a top tier school (since another placation they often throw around is that Google is way harder to get into than an Ivy League school, this does once again seem irrelevant). The worst part is that most people don't listen about these things, the times I've told people that we are underorganized and it's going to cause problems later, the general response is to ignore it and/or not be proactive."",""Your processes are broken. Try asking about that more often and see how many people tell you so. True innovation comes from admitting something is wrong and then fixing it, not blindly running in one direction as fast as you can. Groupthink is the worst possible condition for an """"innovating"""" company to have, and if you don't recognize it soon, nobody will want to work with you.

Google is investing heavily (in new hires, acquisitions, etc) and any benefits from this spike in investment will take some time to catch up with the costs, and there is no guarantee that they ever will.  I am a relatively recent (post-recession) hire, and after way over a year on the job I still feel that I am evaluating Google and wondering whether I can have a career here, which is not a good sign. Compared to previous jobs, I feel less recognized, having to work more, less proud of my work, and being more conscious on the effect that specific projects will have on my career instead of just doing what is right for the users/company. It is not that I am less smart/capable/experienced than others, it's just that the opportunities are less compared to someone who joined earlier. The work is not the most interesting I ever done, but it is OK and gives me the opportunity to expand my technical breadth. If this is all Google needs from me, then I am likely to move on, more sooner than later, and if this is a common experience of the relatively recent hires then the smartest and the brightest will not be flocking to Google anymore. Nothing particularly wrong with Google, I assume that's part of a company's normal progression from start-up to behemoth, and I still recommend giving Google a try, especially for new grads as it can be a good place to jump-start an engineering career. Just keep an eye on what you're getting out of your work and don't let the perks distract you from the bigger picture."",,3.0,,2.0,3.0,4.0,17,3.0"

This mean that on quarterly and annual review your manager will inflate the work done by his favorite employees and strongly back their deserving for a bonus, promotion etc, while having little to say to the committees about the value of your work. If promotions are rare and reserved for a select few, raises are almost non-existent and far below inflation.  20% time mean you have to sleep less and work more during the week and forget about weekends. The running joke is that 20% percent means you work 20% more time than the current 140% time you spend on a fictional 40h work week.  Taking vacation lower your performance ratings resulting in lower bonus and less chance for a promotion or raise. Same goes for sick days, parental leave, or even for being unreachable on a weekend (while not on call).  Some of my coworkers had to complain to HR about their managers and got little support. HR would not recognize any wrongdoing and downplay issues as personality mismatch and misunderstandings. I've witnessed situations unblock with HR only after a VP was contacted for help by the employee."",""Get back in touch with the grumpy people, they are saying out loud what the majority is thinking silently. Of course you'll have old timers that are in a niche and know the right people to love how they are being treated, also you have the happy newbies that are not disappointed yet of not being recognized after a full year of hard working. Grumpiness is usually dismissed as 'entitlement' from some employees, but these same employees accepted lower salaries to join Google in exchange for working in Lala Land, of course they are grumpy when they wake up.  Make the career development efforts real, making bigger promisees without actually delivering real results will just frustrate the employees more. Develop and facilitate exchange programs between roles, but not limited to 10-20 people, that's not how you satisfy 10000 unsatisfied employees. Requiring that you be a top top performer in your current role is ridiculous, if the employees want to try something else it's probably because they not so happy in their current role and not performing at their full potential.  One way to improve career development and work life balance is to have *strong* incentives for managers to truly support *all* their employees to do 20% time, career development, work life balance. Also force the manager to take their vacation days, instead of setting the benchmark of working all the time. A manager that lose several his direct reports in a few months and unable to hiring replacements should be harshly sanctioned, not promoted.  Conduct surveys more often, one Googlegeist per year does not seem to help that much when it takes so much time to react and see the results. Open the committees to silent attendants, so employees can see how the process truly works, instead of hearsay and the 'official' guidelines. Create incentives for work/life balance, it's fine to reward the workaholics but too much of it, as it is now, destroys team morale.  React *now*, it will be too late after mid-september when I predict a massive exodus of under-appreciated talented people.

"7718,startup_1,,"" May 15, 2009"",Former Employee , Quality Rater,""Horribly Unsatisfying Communication, Enjoyable Work"",""My story is a little different than most others because I was a temp worker for Google, testing search results for a year. I enjoyed the work a great deal, there were always new interesting things to test, and I got to see things like Maps and Timelines long before they were released to the public and help make them better. The pay was reasonable - $15/hour working from home - and there were good bonuses after a certain number of hours had been completed, or occasionally given for working on specific projects."",""There were two major downsides of doing temp work from home for Google. One was the astonishing lack of communication. This shifted a little while I was working there, they began developing a sort of report card system so that we could see how our rating work scored compared to previous months and how we were doing overall. But while I was there, that system only worked for a small fraction of the projects I was working on, so it wasn't particularly helpful.  More to the point, there was no positive feedback given to anyone at all, and communication between employees seemed to be discouraged - two classic characteristics of a dysfunctional work environment. Occasionally if a rating was very far off of what they were looking for - usually due to a typo or misclick - they would send it back with a warning saying so, but that represented the sum total of feedback given. Personally, I found it very difficult to work with no input about whether they wished I were going faster, whether I was going faster than my peers, whether I was doing a great job, or - most of all - any input about how to improve in general. Sure, it's a year-long temp job, but one which can potentially be repeated after another year has passed - and besides, who doesn't want to receive positive feedback and learn how to improve and receive more? I guess more importantly, who doesn't want to know what the expectations for their work are??  The one saving grace for me was that I found a forum for people working from home where some other folks who were doing temp work for Google could get together and chat a little - without breaking any confidentiality agreements - about what we struggled with, how much we were able to do in a day, and what we thought the expectations for us were, based on all of our experiences.  The other major downside was that the temp agency they used, WorkForceLogic, was just TERRIBLE - specifically at handling payroll, which is a terrible thing to be terrible at. There were many times that I didn't get paid, got a bonus deducted from my check instead of added to it, et cetera - and it was always a different mistake from all the ones they had made before, and it always took them a while to figure out what had gone wrong, track down whoever needed to fix it, wait for them to get back from lunch or an appointment or come back to work the next day or.... And they were no better at communication, really, I had hoped that once this assignment was up I would be able to get more assignments through WFL, but no matter how many phone calls I made, nobody could ever figure out who I should be talking to or find anyone who would return calls."",""From what I have heard, communication and job satisfaction are a growing problem everywhere in Google, and as with any large corporation this has the largest effect at the bottom of the totem pole.

There are really well run teams...and very badly run teams. The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year.   - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived. You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned. There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.   - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)   - A chance to make a huge difference   - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself   - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).   - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain"",""- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that. - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today. It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.  I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone."",""Stack ranking is a horrible practice since it's rife with favoritism. It's also not Amazonian in that it's not data based (arbitrarily designating a certain percentage of employees that must be put on performance management isn't a data driven criterion) and it's not frugal (effectively forcing an individual out of the company in one division who would make the grade in another is either retaining someone who doesn't meet the bar or a waste of talent). The goal is to force managers to actually make the hard decisions about how their team members compare with each other (not everyone can be exceptional), but it has more defects than virtues. Replace it with a common comparison of each person against the bar for their position, based on data. The percentages that are assigned to each performance category will turn out how they turn out, but there will be an evaluation mechanism that's fair and frugal."",3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1275,3.0"

At Amazon Web Services (AWS), where I work, you would be hard-pressed to find more interesting, challenging, and future-thinking technology. One of my favorite things about working at Amazon in general is the inclusion--Amazon proudly employs, and vocally supports, minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals (including transgender persons), veterans, and people with disabilities. My entire management hierarchy, including myself, is made up of women (until reaching the CEO, Andy Jassy, who is male). As a young employee, I feel like my opinions are valued, and that I'm not looked down on due to my age or tenure. If you're hard-working, tenacious, and incredulous, you can find a place at Amazon."",""Amazon is an extremely fast-moving workplace, which is exciting, but it can also be exhausting if you don't know how to manage the pace. It is critical to set a work/life balance for yourself (or as Jeff Bezos says, work/life harmony). Management also plays a huge part in how much people enjoy working at Amazon. I have heard of people having night and day experiences on two similar teams, or even the same team, due to a change in management. The process to be promoted can also extremely vary across organizations, and there is a lack of inconsistency in who is promoted, after what time period. You need to be an advocate for yourself when you work at Amazon (but I've found many mentors who helped me grow this skill, personally and professionally, during my time here)."",,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0,3.0"

So I decided to go public. I am sure there is going to be some mud slinging but I am not going to let anyone get hurt. On the other hand, it might make them clarify their position so that the people at BF7 or Sumner, WA are safe.  Please read it all before making a comment To whom it may concern,  There are a few safety concerns here at Amazon that I feel should be addressed before someone is injured.  1) Mech lifts (100 pounds or more) are being performed by one person in order to make rates (even with a tip and slide when the package is on the floor the slammers still have to lift it enough to put it on their pallet.) When an employee asks for help they are made to feel like they are bothering someone.  2) Team lifts are completely ignored. If the employee is expected to lift a package on their own it should be stated ahead of your hiring practice so someone can decide not to work at a bulk facility.  3) Stop signs on the floor are faded and starting to come apart. They need to be replaced. The Stowers also like to park items on top of them.  4) Your rates for pickers are too high and unsafe. If they ask for help every time they follow the supposed safety rules they would not make rates.  5) Your Stowers are building pallets too high and they are causing near misses.  6) The stats should not be a moving target. Managers telling employees that they are expected to double their rates from 24 to 40 or 50 is dangerous and promotes bad habits.  7) Leaving one person to work the floor while all the other employees are in standup across the building is unsafe and will delay emergency response times.  8) When employees ask about company policies the management says they don't know the answer.  9) Trainers are contradicting their safety standards. I was told by one trainer that you could not extend your forks and drive forward while picking. Another trainer said you could. Pickers are pulling out of a pallet and moving to their next pick with the forks on H level and lowering it as they drive through the warehouse.  10) The product is being stacked so high in the bulk area that they are starting to compress and lean in such a manner that it is unsafe to be around them and in some cases pick them.  11) Pickers are expected to climb into bins to pull an order. The product is forced into bins causing pickers to have to pull everything in it in order to find the right order.  12) Competition is good but trash talking other shifts and individual employees is unprofessional and demeaning. When done by associates it can be bad however when it is done by the people in charge it is unacceptable. It encourages unsafe competition and retaliation.  We need to know that safety standards are real and not just lip service."",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4,3.0"

I personally have not experienced any of that nor have I seen or heard anything either, I’m sure that there are good and bad teams or managers, but I have not seen it.  What I have seen is that everyone here is really smart and wants you to succeed in your role and as a company overall. AWS provides the tools and training to help you become successful. It is up to you to apply what you learn and already know to solve the problems discovered in talking with the Customer.  The collaboration individually as well as part of a team is like nothing I’ve experienced. People genuinely want to help each other out and focus on the Customer, their issues we are working (backwards) to solve.  In today’s world, we always hear about how important the Customer is, but at AWS it occurs every day and is not just some marketing tag line. Sitting in a meeting with CxO’s and hearing first hand how truly focused we are on them (the Customer) really instills trust and a long-term relationship. To me working here is AWSome and everyday I come into work ready to take on the next challenge.  If you are looking for a company where you are challenged daily and love to learn, then you will not go wrong in accepting a role with AWS. There is literally unlimited opportunities to learn, grow and take on new responsibilities.  You are the only limitation in where you want to grow and become AWSome."",""No cons, thus so far - honestly. While it is true that there are most likely challenging managers and roles, I’d rather be challenged intellectually and know that what I am doing is solving complex problems than sitting at my desk bored wondering what’s for lunch.

The caliber of projects I was given were on the level of things I did 5 or 10 years ago, and the volume of work was 2-3x what is reasonable if you don't want someone to work until 11pm every night. If you have any level of senior management experience, do not expect to develop and evolve your skill set, expect to be taken advantage of via over-work on basic projects.  They don't offer any management training or understand what good mid-level management looks like. Whether you want to develop as a manager or be managed well, odds are stacked against you. I've never seen so many bad managers in one company.  Beware the smoke and mirrors. There is an extraordinary PR narrative around the company due to it's stock price and Bezos' wealth. Behind the curtain, the company is not as good at data as it pretends to be, and their """"customer obsession"""" is a thinly veiled metaphor for profit-seeking. (They do not understand or value real customer insights nor do they have they evolved much beyond their 1990's playbook of how personalization should work.) All the innovation is also top-down, often from people who have been at Amazon so long, they are out of touch. It's uninspiring.  Myself and countless others I have talked to that are either current of former employees have all noted working for Amazon turns them into someone they don't like.

I feel that my management does a good job at setting me up to get promoted( nothing yet though.. but it looks promising), as well as being supported when I've had problems to work around ( both personal and professional). I've had my opinions respected and given the option of what projects I want to work on. It's been a continual process of learning new skills and technologies, as well as learning more about effective writing and personal skills. I don't feel overworked and my management has never told me that they feel I need to work more. There are a lot of opportunities to grow and learn new things. If you get tired of your team or your job and you want to try something else, cross team transfers happen reasonably often, and I've seen co-workers try out the management track and succeed, or decide it's not for them and move back to tech.  Despite being a larger company, there is a lot less bureaucracy than you would expect. You need a small number of machines to test something, typically approval is automatic. ( as you need more bureaucracy creeps back in with budgets and hardware planning).  Promotion's are progressively becoming a show x skills/abilities, get to next level , as opposed to a more get x people to vouch for you process, at least at the lower levels, which makes it fairly clear on what you need to work on to get promoted.  There is always a new shiny thing being rolled out to make service development better ( faster, cheaper , more operationally stable), but it also takes time to ramp up on it."",""Constant learning is occasionally stressful.  You are surrounded by very competent smart people and if you focus too much on judging yourself against them, instead of just focusing on how you can learn and grow, It's easy to feel inadequate.  It's easy to feel like you can't take break to watch some internal educational videos and learn new things. But you just have to consciously make time for such things.  Now that I've been here long enough,my vests aren't granted as far into the future, so even if the stock keeps on growing, I'm not going to earn as much from the vests unless I hold onto them :(.  The OP1/OP2 planning process has meant in the past that if you want to get something done that's non trivial and it's not on a teams roadmap, unless you can justify that it's more important that what they are doing, it can take a while ( next planning cycle + when planned in that cycle).  So much of internal tech is using AWS that If I ever left amazon, I'd probably be best suited to be an AWS consultant."",I would suggest encouraging employees to take advantage of the internal learning opportunites.,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,8,5.0"

I get that we have to pick 120 units per hour in order to get the orders out on time, but do you have to remind me every time my rate is low? Just leave me alone and let me do my job. Damn. And every time my rate was low, I always got mad at myself which made me focus on that rather than the task at hand. Also, I didn't like that they started ranking us from the picker with the highest rate to the picker with the lowest rate. Is this a competition?  TOT TOT stands for Time Off Task. They calculate TOT from the time you finish a pick to the next time you finish a pick, so if, for instance, you use the washroom. This will not only affect your rate, but your TOT, also. I get it. The less time you spend picking, the less productive you are. I didn't like that everything was timed. Maybe I'm a little salty because ultimately, TOT was what got me fired, but who's to know?  Short Lunch Break Another thing I didn't like was that the lunch break was too short. As a full timer you get a full 30 minute lunch break. FULL 30 MINUTES. Had to make sure the people in the back heard me. By the time I've used the washroom, checked my blood sugar and made my lunch, I have a FULL 15 MINUTES to eat and relax. I know that blood sugar part was personal, but still not enough time for a break. Bottom line, I think the break could've at least been 45 minutes.  Long Hours As a full timer, I worked from 5a.m. - 4:30p.m., with the exception of two 15 minute breaks, and a 30 minute break in which we had to clock in and out of. So, all in all I worked 10.5 hours. As you'd imagine, at the end of the day I'm exhausted and my feet hurt.  Physically Demanding This is a very physically demanding job. Depending on your schedule, you're on your feet for 5-10 hours. Plus, you have to bend, ascend and descend a latter (as as a full timer who's only 5'2"""", I was on a ladder at least 50 times a day), push a cart and sometimes lift heavy grocery bags. As a picker, you have to move pretty fast. Combine that with being in ambient (it's 70 degrees in there) and you'd swear you're in a cardio class. I'd be sweating bullets in there. It was not pretty.  Having to Work in Different Temperatures Amazon fresh has three different picking areas: Chilled, Ambient and Frozen, however they combine these areas to make mixed batches: there's Chilled Ambient, Frozen Chilled and Frozen Ambient. This means that you might have to go from the freezing cold to room temperature in a matter of 30 minutes. I've gotten sick several times from having to do this."",""Specifically have someone prepare carts and dry ice toppers. Fix carts with yellow handles. They swivel too much. Give full timers a 45 minute break. 30 minutes is not enough. Fix yellow dividers between bins. There are several on the ground and that are broken. Tell inbound managers to tell stowers not to put different items of the same brand in the same bin. Be real. Don't make me think I'm doing busy work when I'm not (i.e. stowing). Let me know in advance that if I'm stowing all day I have a rate and TOT. Finally, all management should be fired."",3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,13,3.0"

All they care about is your ability to paradoxically be subservient while at the same time displaying leadership qualities. There is no rhyme or reason to management. Expectations vary widely from Team Manager to Team Manager. They will preach and preach “Hire and Develop the Best” which is one of Amazon’s business pillars, but that is never practiced in reality. It is a nepotists wet dream at the PSC Kennewick location, with brown-nosers or people who are in bed with other people getting promoted over individuals who are actually qualified for the positions they apply for.  Additionally there is a HUGE disconnect between Amazon Customer Service and Amazon Corporate. If you begin with Amazon Customer Service you have zero chance of getting promoted beyond L2 (L = Level) or L3, especially if you are trying to get promoted into Amazon Corporate because Amazon Corporate L4 is like Amazon Customer Service L6 or L7. You have to get approval from your Team Manager if you apply for any positions higher than yours so if you are not buddy-buddy with your Team Manager he/she can immediately send negative feedback about you to the hiring manager and shoot down any chance of you being hired. You are also limited to applying to 4 jobs at a time, so you actually have a better chance at getting hired with Amazon Corporate if you don’t work for Amazon.  There is a curious pattern of hiring from outside of Amazon directly into leadership as well, so lower level agents really have no chance at getting promoted unless they’ve got a really brown nose or other connections within the leadership to help promote them."",Actually develop the best as the culture of Amazon promises!,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,2.0"

The nice thing about Amazon is that it's such a large place that you can find the community and team you're looking for-- it just might take a few iterations.,""Transparent communication is sometimes hard to find. Restructuring and reorging can take an emotional toll on teams and the ambiguity that creates opportunity also creates uncertainty. I would also love to see a greater public investment in to the Seattle community. Regardless of why or how, Amazon had dramatically changed the landscape of a city I adore and I don't think we're great at owning that change and ensuring that we are publicly working to help the local community. Amazon contributes to a lot, but we don't tell anyone and we don't show it. If you aren't able to be visible within your team, your chances of promotion or advancement are fairly limited. Work should speak for itself, but if other people don't know that you've contributed you'll have a hard time moving up."",,,,,,,0,4.0"

Amazon is absolutely worth working for, if only for at least 18 months (less than that just isn't a full dose), because you'll likely never find an environment with this much intensity, rigor, and diligence. And the people--smart. Unfailingly smart, at every level. Few companies think bigger, too, this is a vital part of the culture, and one of the best. You'll always have a chance to think more expansively and imaginatively, and while it may not go anywhere people do appreciate it."",""Sadly, for designers, I can only recommend Amazon as a stepping stone. It's a great place to come to if you've never worked for any of the other FANG companies or unicorn startups. Just don't stay too long, use it for some added credibility and some seriously intense experience, and then move on. Why is this?  First off, Amazon has no taste when it comes to design and little interest in fostering a really full, complete understanding of what it takes to design a product and a great experience. You've seen the site, and you've seen how things like FireTV and Kindle are at best at-parity with similar competitive products. There's no daring in the design here. Good enough is well more than enough.  And in AWS, which badly needs intelligent and exceptional design, there are limitless opportunities but an unlimited amount of increasingly cumbersome bureaucracy to hack through. It's miserable and discouraging and soul-crushing. You'll get bogged down in menial, tactical micro-details, and you will be micromanaged, before you really can get a sense of how valuable (or not) the service you're working on is."",Pay attention to the creative people you've got.

There was really only a couple that treated people consistently with some respect, the majority were just unnecessarily rude. Though AMZL was not evaluating employees on their scanning rate, it could be difficult to get even your 16 hours in due to being sent home early during slow weeks and so it becomes necessary to try to pick up hours on the scanning side, where it can be extremely difficult to meet their high scan rate demands. Managers on the scanning/ sort side generally don't know people by name since there's just too many coming and going, so it tends to be much less of a team environment than AMZL. Conversions to 'blue badge"""" (regular part-time) positions only happen a couple times per year- after the Christmas peak in late January, then again whenever HR decides, which will likely happen before they begin hiring for the next peak season in the fall, so if you miss out on it the first time as I did, it's almost better to quit and try to get re-hired as a blue badge rather than be strung along by HR telling you that conversions """"will happen again soon""""--they won't. At least that way you can earn the 12.75 that you did during the holiday season, and not bust your butt working for 11.50, which is what they set your pay at come Jan. 1st if you are seasonal. I say most of this to help those who may be going in as a seasonal person so they will know not to buy into anything HR says about seasonal employees once the rush is done. They will not just terminate you into any """"alumni program""""- there is no such thing. Just convert to a blue badge at the first opportunity- they will not make this clear to new people, so if you even think you want/need to be working there beyond January, just go to a blue badge. Otherwise, you could find yourself working with new co-workers who never worked a peak season that already have blue badges and make more money than you."",""Please put the """"human"""" back in your human resources department by hiring people who actually like serving customers (i.e., the warehouse employees). Be more up front with seasonal people about the whole blue badge conversion and what that means right from the beginning. Don't send them emails right after Christmas telling them they will soon be terminated and placed into a non-existent alumni program that will """"fast-track"""" them through the re-hiring process should they decide to come back. It's just wrong and misleading---and not good business. At least treat the people who helped you get through your busiest time fairly. Should also not penalize seasonal employees when they take on other jobs by forcing them to request the minimal time off they are given in no less than 2-hr increments. If someone has another job that makes them less than an hour late, they shouldn't have to request a full 2 hour block of time. Of the 20 hours I was given as a seasonal employee, I probably actually used only 10--you don't get what's left of the 2 hrs if you only need 30 or 40 minutes of it.

So depending on where you are working that day, sometimes you can't get to the restrooms before you have to turn around and start walking back to avoid being late back from break. If you catch yourself making a mistake, there is no way to correct it. You just have to let it go through and realize you might be written up/fired for it. This is especially bad, because there is no learning curve for the job, and new employees are held to higher accuracy quotas than permanent employees.
